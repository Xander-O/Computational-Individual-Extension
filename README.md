Xander Outram's code for aeroplane individual report.
Each vid file has the data from one of the 3 test flight videos. This includes velocities and acceleterations in the x and y-planes.
Then there is also the main code used, to estimate D from the given data in the vid files. You have tor run the vid file to get the data onto your workspace, then run DEstimator.
The final file was just to calculate the mean average data collected.
